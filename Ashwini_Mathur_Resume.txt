\section{\sc Mtech Thesis Topic}

\begin{itemize}
    

\item{\bf Title:} Bird Image Classification Algorithm\\
\textbf{Abstract:} We describe a Bird detection technique that uses the Combine feature of Global shape descriptors and local shape descriptors, instead of using commonly used part based representation. With that we also analyses the visual bag of feature technique use for classifying the classes of Bird Images. This approach in considerably achieves a significant performance improvement on an extensive data set CUB-2000-2011. This method is valuable for detection of texture objects that are viewed against background clutter. This methodology shows how high frequency gradients can be better deal with interfering texture of shape within the bird-like objects which is major problem in detection of bird like objects. Furthermore the classification accuracy  analysis through support vector machine, naive classifier and decision tree methods with comparative analysis of results..\\

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    

\item{\bf Title:} Motion Compensation using Block Matching Algorithm\\
\textbf{Abstract:} The main aim of this project is to design motion compensation technique using Block Matching Algorithm to achieve efficient video compression.\\

\end{itemize}


\section{\sc B.Tech Projects}
\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Title:}  Computer Science Department Portal (Major Project)\\
\textbf{Abstract:} It is a user-friendly application, design to allow any department of a college to manage the information related to its members, resources and events more efficiently by providing Department's Documentation and Management. This application speeds up the complete process thereby saving time and energy of manpower.\\
